---

My name is Steve Platz. Iâ€™m a developer, process analyst, architect, and drummer. I work in the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina area in the Customer Engagement group at [LORD Corporation](http://www.lord.com). This blog, its content and opinions are my own. My goals with this site are to blog about technology, gadgets, the web, and things I find interesting.

You can find me around the web at various places like [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/steveplatz), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/steveplatz), [GitHub](http://www.github.com/steveplatz), and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/48421/steve-platz). I keep an up-to-date list of social links in the footer of this page.
